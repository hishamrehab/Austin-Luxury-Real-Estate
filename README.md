# Austin Luxury Realty

A marketing-style website for a luxury real estate brand in Austin, Texas. It showcases listings, neighborhoods, agents, buyer/seller flows, and contact touchpoints with a light/dark theme.

## Tech stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript**
- **Vite 8** for dev server and production builds
- **React Router 7** for client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS 4** (with `@tailwindcss/vite`) and custom theme tokens (sage, charcoal)
- **Radix UI** primitives (e.g. dialogs)
- **Lucide React** icons, **Motion** for section animations, **Geist** variable font
- **class-variance-authority**, **clsx**, **tailwind-merge** for component styling utilities

## Getting started

Requirements: **Node.js** (LTS recommended) and **npm**.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

Path alias: `@/` → `src/` (see `vite.config.ts`).

## Features (high level)

- **Listings**: Filter/sort, paginated “show more” with loading state, rich listing detail pages with gallery and related properties.
- **Saved properties & neighborhoods**: Client-side “loved” collections with dedicated routes `/saved-properties` and `/saved-neighborhoods`; state lives in React context and **localStorage** (`LovedListingsContext`, `LovedNeighborhoodsContext`).
- **Neighborhoods**: Filterable community grid and per-neighborhood detail routes.
- **Agents**: Search/filter directory and modal contact form.
- **Global UX**: Scroll restoration to top on route change and a floating “back to top” control (`ScrollToTop`, `ScrollToTopButton` in `RootLayout`).
- **Theming**: `ThemeProvider` wraps the app in `main.tsx`; the header `ThemeToggle` drives the `html` `dark` class and `color-scheme` in `index.css`.

## Data and assets

Most content is **static TypeScript data** (e.g. `home/data.ts`, `agents/agentsData.ts`, `neighborhoods/neighborhoodsData.ts`, `listings/listingsDetailData.ts`). Listing photography uses curated **Unsplash** URLs in `listings/listingImageUrls.ts` where noted.

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is written to `dist/`. Deploy `dist/` to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, S3 + CloudFront, etc.) configured for SPA fallback to `index.html` on unknown paths.

Private project (`"private": true` in `package.json`).
